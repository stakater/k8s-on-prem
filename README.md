# k8s-on-prem
how to run production grade kubernetes on prem?

So, if you're interested on continuing CoreOS, tectonic and matchbox gets you CoreOS on-prem (@dghubble  is a great resource). If you're looking at Ubuntu as an OS, I'd recommend MAAS and conjure-up.

Very well summarized discussion on different options:

Use conjure-up to run k8s on Ubuntu 16.04 VM; [Kubernetes on Ubuntu VMs](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/10/06/kubernetes-on-ubuntu-vms/)
